Corrections : 
1. In the very initial page (without authentication) there are two options for Login in the navbar section 
opposite to MedAI logo and name in the navbar section, I only want to Options for Get Started (as clickable button)
with a login button, Remove the Home, Login(As there are two Remove One Option) and Get Started (One with Normal Text not clickable button)


2. Also remove the Login and get started Button in the Hero Section class : relative overflow-hidden bg-gradient-to-b from-primary-50 to-white px-4 py-16 sm:py-24 lg:py-32
and adjust the UI according to your knowledge 

3.
